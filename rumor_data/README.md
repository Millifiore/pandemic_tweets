## COVID-19 Rumor Dataset(Cleaned)

For our model, we utilized a dataset from the paper " A COVID-19 Rumor Dataset." by Cheng, Mingxi, et al. We cleaned their raw [en_dup.csv](https://github.com/MickeysClubhouse/COVID-19-rumor-dataset/blob/master/Data/en_dup.csv) file and kept the columns we needed for our model.
